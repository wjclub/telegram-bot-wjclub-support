menu_other_bot_down_title: "Some other bot does not work"
menu_other_bot_down_text: "From time to time a bot can stop answering / working. Why? Well, a bot is just another Telegram user (with special abilities, like those buttons below messages). But instead of a human, a program is chatting with you. This program needs to be run on some computer and can crash from time to time. If the bot does not answer for a long time, it may just not be running at the moment. In this case (unless it is a groupagreebot) just tell us about it."
